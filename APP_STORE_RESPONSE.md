# App Store Review Response

## Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed

**Question:** Does the app upload contacts to any server?

**Answer:** 

Yes, our app uploads contacts to our server, but with strict privacy protections:

1. **Only Registered Users**: We only store and upload contacts who are already registered users of our app. We do not store or upload contacts who are not using our app.

2. **Purpose**: Contact information for registered users is stored solely to enable friend-finding functionality within our app, allowing users to:
   - Find friends who are already using the app
   - Organize friends into circles for sharing plans
   - Send invitations to activities

3. **Data Security**: 
   - Contact data is encrypted in transit and at rest
   - We never share contact information with third parties
   - Users can delete their account and all associated contact data at any time

4. **Minimal Data**: We only store the minimum necessary information (name, phone number) for registered users to enable the core friend-finding functionality.

5. **User Control**: Users can manage their contact synchronization settings and choose which contacts to add to their circles within the app.

This approach ensures user privacy while enabling the core social functionality of our app - helping users connect with friends who are already on the platform.
