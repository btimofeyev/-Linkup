✅ 1. Visual Tone
Sleek: Clean spacing, minimal UI, large tappable areas

Modern: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, soft transitions

Fun but Mature: Avoid playful cartoons or heavy gamification — think friendly, not childish

✅ 2. Recommended Color Palette
Use	Color	Hex	Description
Primary	Warm Coral	#FF6B5A	Energetic, modern, friendly
Background	Soft Cream	#FAF9F6	Calm, bright, easy on the eyes
Text/Main	Charcoal Gray	#2E2F45	High-contrast, legible
Accent 1	Mint Green	#A4F1C5	Light, positive CTA actions
Accent 2	Golden Yellow	#FFF4A3	Attention-grabbing, time indicators
Danger/Exit	Watermelon Red	#FF4C4C	For cancel, leave, etc.

These give you a vibrant but clean interface that doesn’t feel cluttered.
